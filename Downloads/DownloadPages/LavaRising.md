# Lava Rising
Added Nov 11 2022, last updated Nov 11 2022.

### [Download Here](https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-SubnauticaMods/raw/main/Downloads/RisingLava.zip)

The Lava Rising mod (also known as RisingLava) adds a layer of lava to the game world. This lava layer can be placed at any level (relative to the ocean level) and can rise or fall at any speed.

The mod can be interacted with through the in-game options and a variety of different commands. An in-depth explanation of what you are able to do can be found in [this video](https://youtu.be/qAajE20KYZE?t=99).

This mod was designed for challenges in mind but also is really fun to mess around with. There are so many possibilities.

Requirements:
