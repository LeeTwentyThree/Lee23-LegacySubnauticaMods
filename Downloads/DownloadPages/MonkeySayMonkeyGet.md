# MonkeySayMonkeyGet

Added Oct 16 2022, last updated Oct 16 2022.

### [Download Here](https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-LegacySubnauticaMods/raw/main/Downloads/MonkeySayMonkeyGet-1.0.1.zip)

This mod uses a speech recognition engine to listen to what you are saying and recreate it in-game! If you say "I need 20 titanium" you'll find 20 titanium in your inventory. If you say "I want to kill that Reaper Leviathan" it will die right in front of your eyes. This mod allows for a lot of things, even JoJo references, and the only limits are your imagination and the incredible amount of bugs when it comes to understanding what you're saying.

If you have an audience to entertain, or just want to goof off in a call with friends, this mod is definitely worth a try.

Requirements:
- [SMLHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

### Troubleshooting

- Make sure you pasted the all 4 DLLs in the Plugins folder of the mod download into the '...Subnautica\Subnautica_Data\Plugins' folder in the game.
- If you are using Windows, hit the Windows key and search "Manage sound devices". Make sure to disable all Input devices besides the microphone you are using.

### Stupid things you can do

- You can summon just about anything in the game, and give yourself just about any amount of any item you want.
- You can summon Star Platinum by saying his name. You can tell him to bring you a certain thng, or all of that thing. For example "bring me every acid mushroom". He'll try his best to do that. Of course you can also stop time by saying "The World". Or fight a Sea Dragon head-on by telling him so. Or even get him to destroy your own Seamoth.
- You can refill your own oxygen, hunger, health, etc... or starve yourself.
- You can explode the aurora.
- You can teleport to just about any place you can name.
- You can have the game play weird sounds.
