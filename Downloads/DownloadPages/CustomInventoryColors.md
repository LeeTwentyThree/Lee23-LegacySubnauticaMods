This mod adds several settings into the mod options tab related to changing the backgrounds of inventory icons.

It might seem like a small change, but I can assure it helps immensely with inventory management and organization. It looks great, too, and it's fully customizable.

If the built-in options are not enough, you have the choice to create your own custom icons by placing images into the Custom folder found within the mod.
